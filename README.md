I Have tried to code the entire frontpage in a single html page,I can even seperate the html,css,javascript parts in different pages.I Have even focused on the date part as when user selects a particular start date with user friendly datepicker then the end date cannot be before date or if the user selects the end date first then start date cannot be before that.The second thing is I have focused on the lists is the tables I can make the entire row also clickable as i have done in my other projects but this time i tried the button thing also for demo i have given only the hidden table for virat(1) and dhoni(2) but in real project I CAN GIVE FOR ALL.Both the tables hidden and open can also be put under a single div also.IN less time i did this much but surely I can use more of my skills using more time.The entire code can be explained by me in person.HOPE you like my hardwork.WAITING FOR YOUR RESPONSE .ENJOYED DOING THIS TASK THANK YOU.
